# Implementation-of-Soft-Margin-SVM

Constructed soft margin SVM which include computation and formulation for
different types of linear and non-linear kernels. Model tested on non-linearly separable data (breast cancer data). Also Contains formulation for
SVM as constrained optimization problems in primal, dual and matrix
form. Formulation is done in matlab for better understanding.
